pseudo code:

for gene in gene.data$gene <(1) group: large and small loadings>
    for SNPsite in SNP_sites <(or 2) group: large and small loadings>
        score[gene] = score[gene]+ <loading corresponding to SNPsite>
        # maybe not just "+"? maybe use log or what?
        # it would be informative to make a comparison between taking the sum to simply counting...
        # make some observations to see the difference.

do wilcox.test/chi-square for score[gene] w.r.t. each path in GO.path
obtain pvalues for each path (H_0: not in this path? (eqi-distributed), H_1: in this path)
sort pvalues[path]
output

first do observations on counts of SNVs per gene...
