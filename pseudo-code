pseudo code:

for gene in gene.data$gene
    for SNPsite in SNP_sites
        score[gene] = score[gene]+ <loading corresponding to SNPsite>
        # maybe not just "+"? maybe use log or what?

do wilcox.test for score[gene] w.r.t. each path in GO.path
obtain pvalues for each path (H_0: not in this path? (eqi-distributed), H_1: in this path)
sort pvalues[path]
output
